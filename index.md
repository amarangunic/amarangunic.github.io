# Ana Maria Marangunic

I am a current PhD student at Universitat Politecnica of Valencia, Spain. My research is focused on analyzing surface displacements in rock glaciers with remote sensing. 
I work in [Geoestudios](https://geoestudios.cl), a company specialized in glaciology, natural risks, geology, among other studies.
