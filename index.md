#### Observations on the Average Annual Temperature in Karachi, Pakistan

- **There is a general upward trend in average annual temperatures from the 1980s to 2023**  
  This may be linked to global climate change, as well as the urban expansion of Karachi, which contributes to the urban heat island effect and overall temperature increases.
- **There are clear gaps and abrupt jumps in the data, particularly between 1950 and 1970**  
  These anomalies are likely caused by missing or incomplete data, errors in historical data collection, or inconsistencies in temperature recording methods. The sharp drop to around 18 °C followed by a sudden rise in 1950 suggests possible data entry issues or lack of quality control in older datasets.
